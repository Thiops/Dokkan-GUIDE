        <p>For the Dragon Ball Z Dokkan Battle, it is a game that has been with me for a long time, since I was a child. So I will introduce the quality gameplay through my experience since the game's 3rd anniversary. And everyone will be able to take this gameplay and try to combine your own gameplay to make it more fun.</p>

        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <img src="https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/PurpleSource126/v4/61/dd/11/61dd1118-f2d7-38d5-c005-0bbb1b6fab75/5ba610ad-fe9e-4c79-831f-ed984b65b588_04-4__U82f1_U8a9e_1242_2208.jpg/392x696bb.jpg" alt="Gameplay Mechanics">
        <p>The first thing I'm going to talk about is the game's gameplay, which I believe everyone should know about more or less. But I'll explain it first. The gameplay will be in the form of collecting orbs, like Candy Crush, releasing attacks. But it's different in that it has a passive, or simply put, the character's ability, which makes the game more interesting.</p>

        <h2>Passive Skill</h2>
        <img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FgD8ot8UYAAFsjr.png" alt="Passive Skills">
        <p>And the next thing is what I mentioned above, which is the Passive Skill, which Grimmick will be something that will change the game and make it more fun. Because if the character only has a normal attack, it probably won't be interesting. And when this comes up, from playing normally, you will have to sit and read the abilities. And recently, the creep power of 2024 is very scary. The Meta Patch almost changes with every update. For example, before, there was no reduction in damage received, or it would be an attack that was less than ten million. But now, we probably know.</p>

        <h2>Leader Skill</h2>
        <img src="https://i.redd.it/214mgl7w0jcc1.jpeg" alt="Leader Skills">
        <p>And another record-breaking game is the leader skill, which is a buff for specific types as shown in the image Powerful Comeback and Miraculous Awakening +180%, as well as the passive skill of each character that makes it more powerful. If you want to know which character's leader skill, <a href="https://dokkaninfo.com/" target="_blank">click here</a>.</p>

        <h2>Event</h2>
        <img src="https://dokkaninfo.com/assets/japan/ingame/events/quest_top_banner_766_2.png" alt="Events">
        <p>This is something you can play just by grinding dragon stones or just playing to try out new characters that you just summoned in the banner or just summoning them for fun. So this is the main content of the game that makes you enjoy the animations of some characters that you are excited about or want to see the damage indicator around 10m++.</p>

        <h2>Last Thing to Mention</h2>
        <img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F7ypVmRW8AAT3Ex?format=jpg&name=4096x4096" alt="Conclusion">
        <p>Something like that, maybe it won't get you bored so much, but you'll feel the boredom, because that happened to me too, and what kept me playing this game was my passion for Dragon Ball and the art of the characters, the mechanics, and just to let you guys know that it's almost 10 years old, and it's going to be the end of 2024, so I wanted to make it the first game before some of the gameplay changes and the games that break it, which happens every anniversary.
            and yeah the best thing that dokkan can do <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DBZWorldvideos/videos" target="_blank">OST</a>.
